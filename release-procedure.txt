The following steps are the rough guide to making a release. Please
update it if you find something inaccurate/missing.

NOTE by Boris: A lot of things *are* wrong in this guide.

1. Update the release information in the following files:

   projects/Win32/VC6/xerces-all/XercesLib/XercesLib.dsp 
   projects/Win32/VC6/xerces-all/XercesLib/XercesLib.mak
   projects/Win32/VC7.1/xerces-all/XercesLib/XercesLib.vcproj
   projects/Win32/VC8/xerces-all/XercesLib/XercesLib.vcproj
   scripts/packageBinaries.pl
   src/xercesc/configure.in
   src/xercesc/util/XercesVersion.hpp
   src/xercesc/util/MsgLoaders/ICU/ICUMsgLoader.cpp
   src/xercesc/util/MsgLoaders/ICU/resources/res-file-list-unix.txt
   src/xercesc/util/MsgLoaders/ICU/resources/res-file-list-wins.txt
   src/xercesc/util/MsgLoaders/ICU/resources/res-file-list.txt
   version.incl
   xerces-c.spec
   doc/Doxyfile
   doc/style/dtd/entities.ent

2. Update the release documentation in the following files:

   doc/migration.xml
   doc/migration_archive.xml
   credits.txt
   web/doc/releases.xml
   web/doc/releases_archive.xml
   web/doc/feedback.xml

3. Build and test the release on the platforms that binaries are being
   produced for. The source packages should be named 
   xerces-c-x.y.z.zip/tar.gz.
   In order for rpm to work correctly the actual directory containing the
   source that will be zipped/tarred up should be xerces-c-x.y.z.
   The binary packages should be named 
   xerces-c-x.y.z-{arch}-{os}-{compiler}.zip/tar.gz.

4. Generate PGP/GNUPG signatures for dist binaries and source packages.
   That is, add public key to the SVN KEYS file if necessary and make sure
   public key is on a key server or two. You will also need to update the
   KEYS file on the website:

   scp KEYS username@minotaur.apache.org:/www/www.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c

5. Upload the binaries and signatures to the dist section of the website,
   from the directory containing the binaries:

   scp * username@minotaur.apache.org:/www/www.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/binaries

6. Upload the source packages and signatures to the dist section of the 
   website, from the directory containing the sources:
    
   scp * username@minotaur.apache.org:/www/www.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/source

7. Logon to minotaur.

   ssh minotaur.apache.org

8. Generate md5 signatures for dist binaries and sources on minotaur using:

   md5 -r xerces-c_x_y_z.tar.gz > xerces-c_x_y_z.tar.gz.md5

9. Make sure the packages have the correct permissions (chmod 664*).

10. Remove the previous release source and binaries (double checked that
    they are archived) in the source and binaries directories. Remove the
    links in the /www/www.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c directory (*current*
    that were pointing at the old sources in the source directory).

11. Create the new links for the source (do for each file including asc
    and md5):

    ln -s ./source/xerces-c-src_x_y_z.zip xerces-c-current.zip

12. Go to the archive, /www/archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c and create
    a directory for the previous release (xerces-c-x.y.z). Move over the
    contents of the source and binaries directories to this new directory.
    Remove the *current* links.

13. Update the archive.

    cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c
    cp -R * /www/archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c

14. Verify that the downloads are available. Note that it can take up to 
    24 hours to for the mirrors to be updated.

15. Update the website by taking a binary package and extracting the 
    doc/html directories. The web pages are stored in 
    /www/xml.apache.org/xerces-c. You will also need to update the
    documentation pdf in the pdf directory (which has both a pdf and
    pdf.tar.gz). Recommend copying the new documentation over the
    existing files. Be sure to change the permissions on the files
    and directories:

    find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} ;
    find . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} ;

    If the binaries are for different platforms you may also need to 
    update the download.html file to point to the new binaries.
    Verify that the website is updated (may take a while to be 
    refreshed on the real webserver).

16. Send out an announcement e-mail to the c-dev@xerces.apache.org and 
    c-users@xerces.apache.org mailing lists and cc the 
     announcements@xml.apache.org and pmc@xerces.apache.org mailing lists.

17. Update the list of versions in Jira for xerces-c.

18. Tag the release in SVN (tags for releases usually have the form 
    Xerces-C_x_y_z where x.y.z is the Xerces-C release number) by doing:

    svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/c https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xerces/c/tags/Xerces-C_x_y_z \ -m "Tagging the Xercesc x.y release"

    For more information on tagging see
